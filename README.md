### Brief Descriptions
The project ‘*Student Information System*’ is a console based application to manipulate students’ information from/to a text (extension .txt) file. It can perform some operations; like displaying, inserting, updating, deleting, searching, sorting students and generating reports on those things. The students' information has been stored and manipulated in a Doubly Linked List (under heap memory). While deleting, the dynamically allocated memory for a particular data to be deleted has also been deallocated. This simple project holds each student's information as an object in the linked list which is sufficient for objectifying the fundamental concept of data structure where the objects are arranged in a linear order.
